# sado-bot
Sado is a work-in-progress, multipurpose, hyper-customizable discord bot which allows discord server admins to more efficiently manage channels. 

### Setup For Development
Donwload NodeJS (and npm) from Nodejs
```
https://nodejs.org/en/
```
Then clone the repository,
you can do so through the terminal (in the directory of your choice) by the command 
```
git clone https://github.com/Aarian-A/sado-bot
```
In the terminal of the cloned directory,
run the following commands to set package configs
```
npm init
```
Then, install discord node modules:
```
npm install discord.js
```
Now, create a "congfig.js" file and add the following:
```js
module.exports = {
    token: "insert bot token here"
}
```
Now you're ready to interact with the repo!

### Guidelines
Once cloned, create a branch, you can use terminal:
```
git checkout -b <branch_name>
```
Example:
```
git checkout -b reaction-testing
```
Now, make this branch remote for others to access:
```
git push -u origin <branch_name>
```
Now that you're set up, create Pull Requests to make changes to the main branch

### Cleanup
You can delete local branch using 
```
git branch -d <branch_name>
```
Now you can delete the remote branch:
```
git push -d origin <branch_name>
```
